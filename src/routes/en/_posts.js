    title: "Hydrogen",
    slug: "hydrogen",
    num: 1,
    reason: "From the Greek word <i>hydro</i> (water), and <i>genes</i> (forming)",
    history:
      "Henry Cavendish was the first to distinguish hydrogen from other gases in 1766 when he prepared it by reacting hydrochloric acid with zinc.<br><br>In 1670, English scientist Robert Boyle had observed its production by reacting strong acids with metals.<br><br>French scientist Antoine Lavoisier later named the element hydrogen in 1783.",
    uses:
      "Liquid hydrogen is used as a rocket fuel.<br><br>Hydrogen is commonly used in power stations as a coolant in generators.<br><br>Hydrogen's two heavier isotopes (deuterium and tritium) are used in nuclear fusion.<br><br>Used as a shielding gas in welding methods such as atomic hydrogen welding.",
    facts: "Hydrogen is the primary component of Jupiter and the other gas giant planets",
    dangers: "Hydrogen poses a number of hazards to safety, from fires when mixed with air to being an asphyxiant in its pure form",

    title: "Helium",
    slug: "helium",
    num: 2,
    reason: "From the Greek word <i>helios</i>, the sun",
    history:
      "French astronomer Jules Janssen obtained the first evidence of helium during the solar eclipse of 1868.<br><br>Norman Lockyer and Edward Frankland suggested the name helium for the new element.<br><br>In 1895, Sir William Ramsay discovered helium in the uranium mineral cleveite.<br><br>It was independently discovered in cleveite by Per Teodor Cleve and Abraham Langlet.",
    uses:
      "Helium is used as a protective gas in growing silicon and germanium crystals, in titanium and zirconium production, and in gas chromatography.<br><br>Helium at low temperatures is used in cryogenics.<br><br>Helium is used for filling balloons and for pressurizing liquid fuel rockets.<br><br>Helium is used as a shielding gas in arc welding processes.",
    facts: "Unlike any other element, helium will remain liquid down to absolute zero at normal pressures",
    dangers: "Helium is not known to be toxic",
    desc: "Vial of glowing ultrapure helium",
    isotopes: "Isotopes of Helium",
